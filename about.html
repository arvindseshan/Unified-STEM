								<h2>What is Unified STEM?</h2>
								<p>STEM for Everyone</p>
							</header>
							<p>
								Unified STEM is a fully inclusive, co-ed extracurricular program with the goal of integrating students with and without disabilities in a competitive team setting. All students train and compete as equal teammates and, through this experience, hopefully build life-long friendships. Unified STEM is a way to expand current social and athletic opportunities to the realm of STEM competition.
<br><br>
								Unified STEM in Western PA was started in Fall 2021 by Fox Chapel Area High School student, Arvind Seshan. In addition to being a member of Best Buddies and the Founder of the FC Hacking & Computing Club, Arvind has also been a participant in FIRST Robotics for 12 years. Combining his experiences in all these programs, he wanted to develop more inclusive STEM programs in the region. To achieve this mission, he created the district's first Special Olympics Unifed Robotics program. Unified Hackathon is scheduled to begin in Fall 2022. Read more about Unified Robotics at Fox Chapel in <a href="https://viewer.joomag.com/in-fox-chapel-area/M0264874001460743658">InCommunity Magazine (Pg.15)</a>. Our goal is to extend Unified STEM to other schools in Western PA after the completion of pilot programs at Fox Chapel.
								<p>
								<b> Our objectives are to: </b><br>
								1.	Provide additional engagement opportunities for students with and without disabilities (IDD).<br>
2.	Increase the accessibility of academic and STEM events for students with and without disabilities.<br>
3.	Inspire all students with and without disabilities to consider STEM careers and unite students of diverse abilities as teammates and competitors.<br>
4.	Align with the goals of Best Buddies to help all students improve public speaking and communication skills.
