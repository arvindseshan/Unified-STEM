										A hackathon is a design event where programmers and hardware developers collaborate to complete a specific project within a designated period of time. Traditionally, hackathons have been targeted towards talented high school and university students. The Unified Hackathon is unique in that it creates a more inclusive (unified) opportunity for students of all abilities to work together and experience the benefits of a hackathon. We are excited to collaborate with the Carnegie Science Center to create what is likely the first hackathon for students with and without intellectual and development delays. The event is open to schools, homeschools, as well as any student in Grades 9â€“12 who wishes to participate. Students of all levels are invited to participate and will be placed into teams of four. The goal of this program is to afford students of all abilities the opportunity to develop STEM skills in a collaborative and inclusive environment. Registration is now open.
