										Unified Robotics exposes students with and without disabilities to engineering, programming and robotics, while also fostering social inclusion, equity, understanding and belonging. Students without disabilities, who are active members of Best Buddies, work alongside students with disabilities in partnerships to build robots in small teams (4 students) using LEGO® MINDSTORMS sets donated to FCAHS by LEGO® Foundation and SPIKE Primes sets purchased through funding from Amazon in the Community and FIRST/Disney. Each team designs, builds, and programs their own robot during the weekly afterschool sessions. On the final Competition Day, each team competes in a tournament-style competition. Students must be an active member of Best Buddies, be able to remain after school, and have their own transportation home. Space is limited. If you are a student in Fox Chapel Area High School, you can sign up via the Educational Support Department (Contact Dr. Dokonovic, Stacie_Dojonovic@fcasd.edu).

										If you would like to start Unified Robotics at your school, please contact us. We can share our process and curriculum.
