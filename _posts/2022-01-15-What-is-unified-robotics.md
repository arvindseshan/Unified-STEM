Unified Robotics was started in 2015 by Delaney Foster and her FIRST Robotics Competition teammates in Washington. Inspired by Special Olympics Unified Sports, the the goal is to bring together students with and without intellectual and developmental delays together. In 2017, Delaney brought Unified Robotics to all high school in Washington and organized a multi-school event.

The concept is modeled after FIRST Core Values and designed to put into practice the concept of Inclusion. Teams of 2-6 students build and program a robot. Every single participant is involved.
