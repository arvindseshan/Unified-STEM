We were extremely excited to welcome 25 students to our first practice today. Our goals for the day were to create teams, have them pick names, and then build their first robot. All teams are making the same base robot to facilitate doing programming lessons next week. All teams worked well together. A few teams were ahead of the others as they found it easier to find the right LEGO elements.

1. Before the students show up, work with your school faculty to set up teams based on their knowledge of the students. You want the teams to be as equitable as possible and for everyone to have a positive experience.
2. Team building is important. Use the first meeting to have students pick team names and get to know each other.
3. It is best to have everyone building the exact same robot to start with. Something simple with basic sensors that can be modified by the teams later on is best for learning to program.
4. Teams will not all work at the same pace. Have some additional activities or challenges for teams that finish early.
5. Learning to work together is also an important skill. One student can look at the instructions and another find the right LEGO element. Yet another student can put it on the robot. Have them switch roles so that everyone has a turn.
