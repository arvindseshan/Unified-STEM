Fundraising is a key part of successfully setting up a Unified STEM program at your school. At Fox Chapel Area High School, we started fundraising in late Fall and by March had secured all our fundraising needs to start Unified Robotics.

1. Check with your school technology education department to see if they have LEGO MINDSTORMS or SPIKE Primes that you may be able to borrow.
2. Check with a local FIRST team. FIRST Robotics Competition or FIRST LEGO League teams may have sets you can borrow.
3. Work with your FIRST Team or school faculty to set up a Donors Choose campaign specifically for Unified STEM programs.
4. Apply for community grants such as Amazon in the Community.
