For programming lessons, we used modified versions of tutorials found at <a href="http://www.ev3lessons.com">EV3Lessons</a> and <a href="http://www.primelessons.org">PrimeLessons</a>. The lessons focused on moving forward/backwards, simple turns, using color/force sensors and using loops.

Students were taught the new Scratch-based language by LEGO rather than the graphical EV3-Lab that was recommended by the Special Olympics Unified Robotics site as LEGO no longer supports that product. The software was pre-installed and the firmware on all the LEGO hardware was updated prior to the first lesson.

For a basic design, we used the EV3 Core Robot that comes with the LEGO Education 45544 set and a SPIKE Prime robot designed by Arvind Seshan that had a solid base with both color sensors and a force sensor already mounted. Students were able to take these basic designs and modify them into sumo robots. Building Instructions will be made available to anyone else who would like to use this model.
